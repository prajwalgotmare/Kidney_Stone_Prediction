## About Dataset

The kidney-stone-dataset.csv file contains data on 255 patients with kidney stones, including patient characteristics and laboratory test results. The dataset includes a target variable, "Risk of Stone", which is a continuous value representing the risk of developing kidney stones. This dataset can be used to build predictive models for identifying individuals at high risk for kidney stones.
