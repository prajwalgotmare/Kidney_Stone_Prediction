## About the Dataset

The kidney-stone-dataset.csv is a comma-separated values file containing data on patients with kidney stones. The file has 255 rows and 21 columns, with each row representing a patient and each column providing information on various characteristics and laboratory test results. The dataset includes a target variable, "Risk of Stone", which is a continuous variable representing the risk of developing kidney stones.

The dataset contains 12 features related to the risk of developing kidney stones, including age, gender, weight, height, family history, and various blood and urine measurements. The dataset is useful for building predictive models to identify individuals at high risk for kidney stones, which can aid in the development of prevention and treatment strategies.

## Basic EDA

To explore the dataset, I have performed basic EDA by loading the dataset into Python's Pandas library. I have checked for missing values, computed summary statistics, and created visualizations of the data. This EDA helps in understanding the dataset and identifying potential issues that need to be addressed before training models.

## Possible Predictions and Training Different Models

The kidney stone dataset can be used for various predictive modeling tasks, such as predicting the risk of developing kidney stones based on patient characteristics and test results. I have trained different machine learning models on the dataset, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. By comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and other metrics, I have identified the best performing model for predicting the risk of kidney stones.

Overall, the kidney stone dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and healthcare professionals interested in developing better prevention and treatment strategies for kidney stones.
